# Web Framework

A web framework is a software framework designed to aid in the development of web applications by providing a structure for building and organizing code, handling HTTP requests and responses, and implementing common web development tasks. Web frameworks typically include components such as URL routing, request handling, template rendering, database interaction, and security features.

## A Minimal Application

A minimal web application typically consists of a few key components:

- **Application Object**: The central object that represents the web application and provides methods for handling requests and responses.
- **Routing**: Defines URL patterns and maps them to functions or methods that handle the corresponding requests.
- **Views**: Functions or methods that process requests and return responses.
- **Templates**: Files that define the structure and layout of HTML pages, often including placeholders for dynamic content.

## Routing

Routing refers to the process of mapping URLs to views or controller functions within a web application. It allows the application to determine which code should be executed in response to a particular URL request.

## Rendering Templates

Rendering templates involves combining static HTML content with dynamic data to generate HTML pages dynamically. Templates typically include placeholders for dynamic content, which are replaced with actual data during rendering.

## Synopsis

A synopsis is a brief overview or summary of a topic, concept, or piece of code.

## Variables

Variables are placeholders or containers that store data values. In the context of web development, variables are often used to store dynamic data that is passed from the server to the client or vice versa.

## Comments

Comments are annotations added to code to provide explanations, documentation, or reminders for developers. They are ignored by the interpreter or compiler and are intended for human readers.

## Whitespace Control

Whitespace control refers to the ability to manipulate whitespace (such as spaces, tabs, and newlines) in template files. This allows developers to control the layout and formatting of generated HTML output.

## List of Control Structures (read up to "Call")

Control structures are programming constructs that alter the flow of execution based on certain conditions or criteria. Examples include if statements, loops, and function calls.

## Flask

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python. It provides tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and easily, with a focus on simplicity and extensibility.

## Jinja

Jinja is a modern and designer-friendly templating engine for Python, inspired by Django's template system. It provides a powerful and expressive syntax for creating dynamic HTML templates, with support for inheritance, macros, and filters.
